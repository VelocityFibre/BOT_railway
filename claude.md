# Fiber Installation Photo Verification - Technical Implementation

## Recommended Approach: OpenAI Vision API

**Why OpenAI Vision first:**
- Easiest setup (30 minutes vs 2-4 weeks for other solutions)
- Natural language prompts for each installation step
- Good accuracy (80-90%) for general photo verification
- Simple API integration
- Cost-effective for testing ($0.02-0.03 per image)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Quick Setup with OpenAI Vision

**Setup Requirements:**
```bash
# Required packages
pip install openai requests pillow python-dotenv pandas
```

**Core Components:**
1. **Step-specific verification prompts** for each of the 14 installation steps
2. **Image preprocessing** for consistent analysis
3. **Batch verification system** for complete installations
4. **Compliance scoring** and reporting
5. **Missing step detection**

### Phase 2: Production Workflow

**File Structure:**
```
fiber-verification/
├── src/
│   ├── verifier.py          # Main verification engine
│   ├── prompts.py           # Step-specific prompts
│   ├── utils.py             # Image processing utilities
│   └── reports.py           # Report generation
├── photos/
│   ├── pending/             # New submissions
│   ├── approved/            # Verified installations
│   └── rejected/            # Failed verifications
├── config/
│   └── settings.py          # API keys and configuration
└── data/
    └── verification_log.csv # Verification history
```

**Verification Prompts per Step:**

```python
VERIFICATION_PROMPTS = {
    "step1_frontage": """
    Verify this is a property frontage photo showing:
    - Clear view of the house/building
    - Street number visible and readable
    - Daytime lighting conditions
    - No obstructions blocking the view

    Return: PASS/FAIL and specific issues found.
    """,

    "step2_wall_before": """
    Verify this shows the wall location before fiber installation:
    - Clear view of installation area
    - No existing fiber equipment visible
    - Wall surface condition visible
    - Suitable mounting point identification

    Return: PASS/FAIL and installation readiness assessment.
    """,

    "step3_cable_span": """
    Verify proper outside cable installation:
    - Cable running from pole to pigtail screw
    - Proper cable tension (no sagging or excessive tightness)
    - Cable secured at multiple points
    - No cable damage or kinks visible
    - Minimum bending radius maintained

    Return: PASS/FAIL and cable quality assessment.
    """
    # ... continue for all 14 steps
}
```

### Phase 3: Production Features

**Batch Processing:**
```python
def verify_complete_installation(job_id: str, photos: dict) -> dict:
    """
    Verify all 14 installation steps for a complete job
    Returns comprehensive compliance report
    """
    verifier = FiberVerifier()
    results = {}

    for step, photo_path in photos.items():
        if step in VERIFICATION_PROMPTS:
            result = verifier.verify_step(photo_path, step)
            results[step] = result

    return generate_compliance_report(results)
```

**Compliance Scoring:**
- Each step: 0-10 points based on quality
- Overall score: Average of all completed steps
- Missing steps: Automatic 0 points
- Passing threshold: 8/10 points per step, 85% overall

**Reporting Dashboard:**
- Daily verification statistics
- Common failure reasons per step
- Field agent performance metrics
- Installation quality trends

## Migration Path to Custom Models

### Phase 4: Custom Model Training (Future)

**When to upgrade:**
- Processing >1000 installations/month
- Need specialized defect detection
- Require cost optimization at scale
- Want industry-specific fine-tuning

**Recommended upgrade path:**
1. **Google Cloud Vision AutoML** - Custom training with your verified photos
2. **Roboflow** - Hosted custom models with API access
3. **Deepomatic** - Telecom-specialized solution

**Data collection strategy:**
- Save all verified photos with labels
- Mark common failure points
- Build training dataset over 3-6 months
- Target 500+ verified installations per step for training

## Implementation Timeline

**Week 1:** OpenAI Vision setup and basic verification
**Week 2:** Testing with sample installations, prompt refinement
**Week 3:** Production workflow integration, reporting system
**Week 4:** Field testing and feedback collection

## Real-Time Feedback via WhatsApp/Chat

### Immediate Field Agent Support

**WhatsApp Business API Integration:**
- Field agents submit photos via WhatsApp
- Instant AI-powered quality feedback (<30 seconds)
- Step-by-step guidance for retakes
- Progress tracking through installation

**Feedback Messages:**
```
✅ Step 1 (Property Frontage) - PASSED
✅ Street number clearly visible
✅ Good lighting conditions

❌ Step 3 (Cable Span) - NEEDS RETAKE
Issues:
- Cable tension too loose
- Not properly secured at pigtail screw
📸 Please retake showing proper cable tension

Progress: 2/14 steps approved
```

**Chat Flow Benefits:**
- No app installation required (WhatsApp already on phones)
- Immediate feedback prevents wasted site visits
- Guided photo capture reduces errors
- Real-time progress tracking
- Automatic completion notifications

### Technical Implementation

**WhatsApp Integration Options:**
