## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Field agents need to submit photos of their fiber installation steps and receive immediate quality feedback to prevent rework and ensure compliance with installation standards.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a field agent starts a new installation job, **When** they send "START" to the WhatsApp bot, **Then** the bot responds with job ID and requests photo for Step 1
2. **Given** the bot requests a photo for a specific step, **When** the agent uploads a photo, **Then** the bot analyzes it and provides pass/fail feedback within 30 seconds with specific issues if it fails
3. **Given** a photo fails verification, **When** the agent uploads a new photo for the same step, **Then** the bot re-analyzes and provides updated feedback
4. **Given** an agent completes all 14 steps successfully, **When** they finish the final step, **Then** the bot confirms installation completion and generates compliance report

### Edge Cases
- What happens when agent uploads blurry or unreadable photos?
- How does system handle WhatsApp service outages?
- What happens when agent tries to skip steps?
- How does system handle photos with multiple installation elements?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST support starting new installation sessions via WhatsApp
- **FR-002**: System MUST guide agents through all 14 installation steps in sequence
- **FR-003**: System MUST analyze photos for each step using AI vision within 30 seconds
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide specific, actionable feedback for failed photos
- **FR-005**: System MUST track progress and show completion status to agents
- **FR-006**: System MUST store photos with metadata for audit and compliance
- **FR-007**: System MUST support retry functionality for failed photo submissions
- **FR-008**: System MUST generate compliance reports for completed installations
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle multiple concurrent installation jobs per agent
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide help and status commands via WhatsApp

### Key Entities
- **Installation Job**: Represents a complete fiber installation with 14 required steps
- **Photo Submission**: Individual photo uploaded by agent for specific step with verification result
- **Agent Session**: Active interaction between agent and bot for current installation
- **Verification Result**: AI analysis outcome with pass/fail status, confidence score, and feedback
- **Compliance Report**: Summary of completed installation with all verification results
